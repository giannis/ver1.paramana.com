            <p>Paramana takes on projects of various types,
            from analog to
            digital and from purely visual to interactive.</p>
            <p>In innovative web design and
            development we dive into each project’s
            special needs and characteristic concept.

            and out-dated web-sites.</p>
            <p>Design and efficient layout is our priority
            achieved by use of latest

            installation’s development of concept
            and set-up.</p>
            <p>Our prime goal is perfection in detail and
            unrestricted design, qualities
